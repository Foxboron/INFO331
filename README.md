# LOG IN
Starting the application the first time will launch the login page. If you have a profile, use your credentials to sign in to this profile. If you do not have a profile, or wish for a new profile, please press “REGISTER”.

# CREATE NEW USER
When creating a new user profile, please enter desired username in the top input field, followed by the password that you desire for this account. Confirm the desired password in the last input field. If they do not match - try again. Please remember your password.

# CREATE NEW GROUP
Whether you’re a new user or a seasoned veteran, you can always create a new group. If you’re a new user you are immediately presented with the choice of creating a new group or joining a group - both of which are the same activity. When you are presented with the “Create a group” card, swipe down to initiate group creation. In the group creation page, enter a valid group name (cannot be a single character or less, or more than 18 characters). You can add users directly from this panel if you press “Search for users” - although this is optional. Doing so brings up the search input field where you can find specific users if you know them by username. Simply search for the profiles you want and press them to add them to the group. Next up is beacons. The group needs a beacon - you can’t make a group without selecting a beacon first. As with users, simply search for a beacon and select the one you want. When you’ve got your name and your beacons (and possibly users), select “create the group” to do exactly that.

# JOIN EXISTING GROUP
If you want to join a group, swipe to the right to find the “Join a group” card that is adjacent to the “Create a group” card. You are presented with every group available, but you can also search for specific groups. Select the group you want, then press the “JOIN GROUP” button in the center of the screen. If it’s not there it’s because you already joined the group.

# SEARCH FOR GROUPS
Searching for a specific group is done through the [JOIN EXISTING GROUP](https://github.com/Foxboron/INFO331/new/master?readme=1#join-existing-group) part. Simply complete the steps until you are presented with all groups, then you can search for any group you’d like using the text input field at the top of the card.

# SEARCH FOR USERS
Searching for a specific user is done through the [CREATE NEW GROUP](https://github.com/Foxboron/INFO331/new/master?readme=1#create-new-group) part. Simply complete the steps until you are presented with adding users to the group, then you can search for any user you’d like using the text input field at the top of the card.

# SEARCH FOR BEACONS
Searching for a specific user is done through the [CREATE NEW GROUP](https://github.com/Foxboron/INFO331/new/master?readme=1#create-new-group) part. Simply complete the steps until you are presented with adding a beacon to the group, then you can search for any beacon you’d like using the text input field at the top of the card.

# DASHBOARD
If you’re new you will have to join or create a group (or skip that part, which is optional) to get to the dashboard which is the main hub of the app. Here you can see your score, your groups and your events. You can also access the sidebar up top left, three horizontal lines, can’t miss it.

# SIDEBAR
The sidebar is opened from the dashboard, and contains the link to your own profile up top, with your username. Below this you will see the join or create a group link (see [CREATE NEW GROUP](https://github.com/Foxboron/INFO331/new/master?readme=1#create-new-group)) and the log out option.

# USER PROFILE
Your user profile is accessed from the sidebar, or from a group that you have joined. As with the dashboard you can see your own score, latest events and joined groups. If you look at someone else’s profile you can see their score, latest events and joined groups. To look at someone else’s profile, see [GROUP PROFILE](https://github.com/Foxboron/INFO331/new/master?readme=1#group-profile).

# GROUP PROFILE
The group profile is accessed either by completing the steps to [JOIN EXISTING GROUP](https://github.com/Foxboron/INFO331/new/master?readme=1#join-existing-group) or by having already joined the group. If you have joined the group you can find it either by going to the dashboard or your own user profile (see [DASHBOARD](https://github.com/Foxboron/INFO331/new/master?readme=1#dashboard), [USER PROFILE](https://github.com/Foxboron/INFO331/new/master?readme=1#user-profile)). The group profile contains the group points, your own contribution to said points, the members of the group and the beacon that the group is using.

# CHECKING YOUR POINTS
See [DASHBOARD](https://github.com/Foxboron/INFO331/new/master?readme=1#dashboard) or find your user profile (see [USER PROFILE](https://github.com/Foxboron/INFO331/new/master?readme=1#user-profile))

# LOGGING OUT
Press the log out option after accessing the [SIDEBAR](https://github.com/Foxboron/INFO331/new/master?readme=1#sidebar).
